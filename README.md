# Machine-Learning-Assignment-3
Assignment 3 of course ELL409, Statistical Machine Learning take by Prof. Prathosh AP.
This assignment was a kaggle contest for MNIST digit classification. The catch is, the dataset was not the standard MNIST dataset but it was a dataset we created in class. All the students in class were asked to write numbers from 0 to 9 multiple times and hence a handwritten dataset was created. It is completelty different from original MNIST dataset.

So our task was to train a handwritten recognizer on original MNIST datase and get good accuracies on our own dataset too in the kaggle contest.
